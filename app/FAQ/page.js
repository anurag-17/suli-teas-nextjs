              All Suli Teas ingredients are either certified organic or wild
              crafted, also known as wild harvesting. Wild crafted is the
              preferred option when available because it is the practice of
              harvesting plants from their natural habitat while taking care to
              leave enough of the mother plant to ensure sustainability.
              Harvesters also have to demonstrate non-interference with the wild
              crops in accordance with the Organic Food Production Act of 1990.
              These wild harvested herbs are naturally organic but cannot be
              certified as such because they are not under the control of
              growers and processors.

              Herbs and tea kept away from moisture do not go bad. It is common
              to see dates on tea products 18 months to 2 years for optimal
              freshness, but this does not mean the product is unsafe. Keeping
              tea away from heat, light and moisture will keep the flavors
              fresher longer.{" "}

              Senna is commonly used in many cheaply made detox and weight loss

              Most weight loss teas are just generic cheap ingredients with
              convincing packaging. Weight wonder was curated with the fact that
              many people carrying extra weight actually have fluid retention
              from a toxic liver. The herbs in this blend work together to
              support the lymphatic system through their natural diuretic
              properties without losing electrolytes, as well as supporting the
              liver and metabolism.{" "}

              Why caffeine free?{" "}

              Caffeine is a drug and a stress to the system no matter how many
              superfoods some may add to it. It may give superficial energy for
              the moment but it stresses the system in the long run by creating
              a false flight or flight response. In today's world of ADD,
              depersonalization and anxiety caffeine is one of the worst
              triggers for symptoms, and for many it creates the opposite effect
              of brain fog and fatigue. Instead I found legendary plant
              medicines used for millennia that support the body, provide energy
              or relief without addictive harmful ingredients.{" "}
